# FocusOn-Website
A website for a gaming community called FocusOn.
The website is mainly made to sponsor the discord group, and if you check almost all the way down on the webiste you'll find button with text "Join US". If you click on the button you will be redirected to the discord server invitation. The webisite is very basic and homemade for now and wont be public for while until we gather enough people to actually make it an official community, until then this project will be under maintenance. Plan is to buy a domain and publish in late 2025 (Worst case summer 2026).
